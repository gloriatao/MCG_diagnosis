# Prospective Evaluation of Magnetocardiography on Diagnosis and Localization of Ischemic Heart Disease

Abstract
Early identification of ischemic heart disease (IHD) is crucial for effective prevention and management. Magnetocardiography (MCG) has emerged as a promising solution for noninvasive, noncontact, nonradiative, and high-sensitivity assessment of cardiac functions. 
In this study, we present the first multi-center, prospective cohort study evaluating the performance of MCG-based IHD diagnosis and simultaneous localization of ischemic myocardial regions and obstructed coronary arteries. We designed a multiscale vision transformer-based network for spatio-temporal information extraction. Further, we incorporated the anatomical prior knowledge of coronary artery and the irrigated left ventricular regions using graph convolutions (GCNs).
The proposed approach achieved a sensitivity of 83.8\% and a specificity of 85.6\% for diagnosing IHD, whereas obtained and an averaged accuracy of above 71\% for predicting the occurrence of ischemia in five left ventricular regions and an averaged accuracy of above 60\% for recognizing obstructed coronary arteries.
Subsequent analysis on an independent test dataset further demonstrated the efficacy of proposed method.
